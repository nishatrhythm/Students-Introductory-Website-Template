# üöÄ Project Objective and Overview
Imagine being a new student at a university, in a completely unfamiliar department, with a bunch of strangers around you. It can be pretty overwhelming, right? Well, here's the solution: a Students Introductory Website! It's like your personal bridge to connect with fellow students and learn more about each other.

Now, what's cool is that I've created a super user-friendly template for this website. You don't need to worry about servers, costs, or any fancy programming skills. It's as easy as a few clicks! You can customize and publish your very own website for your department's batch using GitHub pages.

The primary objective of the Students Introductory Website is to streamline student information management within a department of educational institutions. Visit [this website](https://nishatrhythm.github.io/CSE11/) to get a overview how it looks like. *(N.B: Admin Panel requires setting up the local server, which will be discussed later).*

So, let's dive right in and make it happen. Say goodbye to feeling lost and hello to making new friends and connections effortlessly!
